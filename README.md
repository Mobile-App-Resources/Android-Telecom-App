# Android-Telecom-App
This was a group project for a software engineering course in university, in which we had to make an app(any platform) for a hypothetical telocommunications company like Verizon, Time Warner, etc. that provides internet, tv, and home phone service. The app allows a a Marketing Rep for the telecom company to create, delete and bundle services along with setting the price. The app also also allows a customer service representative to help a customer add or delete services given the customer's user name. The app allows customers to sign up/log in securely, add/delete services, view bill, and set an option to be emailed when their bill is ready.  

## Technologies
For the UI I used XML and the app functionality using Java. The database api I used for this project was from Parse, free tier for students; unfortunately, they are no longer in business. To send emails I used the MailGun JS API so I could get a custom domain 
name. To generate the bills and email customers I wrote a script in Javascript and set to run monthly on the Parse database. The automated testing was done by one of my partners using Robotium.

##Youtube
I made some videos for this project for extra credit. 

This first video is the first version of the app. I didn't have time to prepare for this video so its not that good.
